# BONUS CHAPTER 2
## OBLIGATORY PASSAGE POINTS: WHERE POWER GETS CONCENTRATED
*Controlling the Choke Points*

---

## üìç AVATAR STATE CHECK-IN

**BEFORE THIS CHAPTER:**
You're working hard in your position, delivering results, but you feel powerless. Decisions happen without you. Resources flow around you, not through you. Critical information bypasses you. You're competent, but not essential. People can work around you. You could be replaced without breaking the system. You're frustrated because you're putting in effort but accumulating no leverage. You don't understand why some people with mediocre skills have more influence than you. You're playing on the edges while others control the center.

**AFTER THIS CHAPTER:**
You'll understand Obligatory Passage Points (OPPs)‚Äîthe strategic choke points in any organization where resources, information, or decisions must flow through. You'll learn to identify these points, position yourself near them, and become one yourself. You'll stop competing for peripheral roles and start targeting positions where power naturally concentrates. You'll become structurally difficult to bypass, making yourself irreplaceable regardless of your formal title.

---

## üíé VALUE STATEMENT

This is the most tactical power strategy in the book. When you control an obligatory passage point, you have leverage far beyond your authority. People need you. They can't route around you. You become a necessary node in the system. The ROI is structural power‚Äîyou're no longer just valuable, you're essential.

## ‚úíÔ∏è DEEP QUOTE

> "All politics is local, and all local politics happens at the choke points." ‚Äî Robert Caro

> "Position yourself at the crossroads, and all paths lead to you." ‚Äî Ancient proverb

> "Power flows through gates, and someone must control the gates." ‚Äî Stewart Clegg

These quotes reveal the truth: power isn't evenly distributed‚Äîit concentrates at passage points.

## üß∂ OPENING STORY: The EA Who Ran the Company

Lisa wasn't the CEO. She was the CEO's Executive Assistant. On paper, she had no authority. In reality, she controlled the most valuable resource in the company: **the CEO's time.**

**Want a meeting with the CEO?** You go through Lisa.

**Want your email to reach the CEO?** Lisa decides what he sees.

**Want your project prioritized?** Lisa controls the agenda.

**Lisa had no formal power. But she controlled an Obligatory Passage Point: access to the decision-maker.** Smart people treated Lisa like she was the CEO. Dumb people dismissed her as "just an assistant." The smart people got their projects approved. The dumb people wondered why their emails went unanswered. Lisa had more practical power than VPs because she controlled a choke point. You couldn't get to the CEO without going through her.

## üí° CORE LESSON: OBLIGATORY PASSAGE POINTS EXPLAINED

**An Obligatory Passage Point (OPP) is a position in a system where things must flow through.**

Not can flow. Not might flow. **Must flow.**

**Characteristics of OPPs:**

1. **Non-optional:** You can't bypass it without breaking the system
2. **Scarce:** There are few (ideally one) routes through
3. **Controlled:** Someone gatekeeps the passage
4. **High-traffic:** Important things flow through it
5. **Structural:** It's built into how the system works, not dependent on personal relationships

**The power comes from being necessary, not from being skilled.**

---

## üéØ TYPES OF OBLIGATORY PASSAGE POINTS

### Type 1: Access Control
*You control access to someone or something important*

**Examples:**
- Executive assistant (controls access to CEO)
- IT admin (controls access to systems)
- Security (controls physical access)
- Receptionist (controls who gets through)

**Power mechanism:** You decide who gets in and who doesn't. Everyone who needs access must go through you.

---

### Type 2: Information Control
*You control critical information or data*

**Examples:**
- Data analyst (controls what reports leadership sees)
- Knowledge manager (controls institutional knowledge)
- Researcher (controls access to research/insights)
- Archivist (controls historical records)

**Power mechanism:** You control what information exists, who sees it, and how it's interpreted.

---

### Type 3: Resource Control
*You control allocation of scarce resources*

**Examples:**
- Budget owner (controls money)
- Procurement (controls vendor access)
- HR (controls hiring/promotions)
- Facilities (controls space allocation)

**Power mechanism:** You decide who gets what. Everyone who needs resources must negotiate with you.

---

### Type 4: Approval Control
*Your approval is required for things to proceed*

**Examples:**
- Compliance officer (must approve for legal reasons)
- Quality assurance (must approve before shipping)
- Department head (must sign off on decisions)
- Legal counsel (must approve contracts)

**Power mechanism:** Nothing moves forward without your approval. You can accelerate or block at will.

---

### Type 5: Technical Control
*You control a system everyone depends on*

**Examples:**
- Platform engineer (controls critical infrastructure)
- Database admin (controls data access)
- Network admin (controls connectivity)
- Tool owner (controls essential software)

**Power mechanism:** The system doesn't work without you. People depend on your expertise and access.

---

### Type 6: Coordination Control
*You coordinate between disconnected groups*

**Examples:**
- Project manager (coordinates cross-functional teams)
- Translator (coordinates between languages/cultures)
- Liaison (coordinates between departments)
- Integrator (coordinates different systems)

**Power mechanism:** You're the connector. Remove you, and the groups can't coordinate effectively.

---

## üîç HOW TO IDENTIFY OPPs IN YOUR ORGANIZATION

**Use the "30-Day Power Circuit Audit"**

### Week 1: Map Information Flow

**Track for one week:**

**Where does critical information originate?**
- Who generates the reports leadership reads?
- Who collects the data?
- Who has the expertise?

**Where does information get bottlenecked?**
- Who has to process it before it moves?
- Who translates it for different audiences?
- Who controls access to it?

**Questions to ask:**
- "If [person] left, what information would stop flowing?"
- "Who has information I can't get anywhere else?"
- "Who do I have to ask for data, reports, or insights?"

**These people control Information OPPs.**

---

### Week 2: Map Decision Flow

**Track for one week:**

**What decisions require approval?**
- Budget decisions
- Hiring decisions
- Project approvals
- Policy changes

**Who must approve them?**
- Whose signature is required?
- Who has veto power?
- Who must be consulted?

**Questions to ask:**
- "What can't happen without [person's] approval?"
- "Who can block decisions?"
- "Who is always in the room when important decisions are made?"

**These people control Approval OPPs.**

---

### Week 3: Map Resource Flow

**Track for one week:**

**What resources are scarce?**
- Budget
- Headcount
- Equipment
- Office space
- Executive time

**Who allocates them?**
- Who decides who gets budget?
- Who decides who gets hired?
- Who controls the schedule?

**Questions to ask:**
- "Who do I have to convince to get resources?"
- "Who can give me what I need?"
- "Who controls access to scarce resources?"

**These people control Resource OPPs.**

---

### Week 4: Map Technical Dependencies

**Track for one week:**

**What systems does everyone depend on?**
- Email/communication
- Project management tools
- Financial systems
- Data platforms

**Who controls them?**
- Who has admin access?
- Who maintains them?
- Who decides how they work?

**Questions to ask:**
- "If [system] went down, who would we call?"
- "Who understands how this works?"
- "Who can give me access, fix problems, or make changes?"

**These people control Technical OPPs.**

---

## üíº HOW TO POSITION YOURSELF AT AN OPP

**Strategy 1: Become Infrastructure-Adjacent**

Don't compete for glamorous roles. Target roles near critical infrastructure.

**Examples:**

Instead of: Marketing Manager

Consider: Marketing Operations (you control the tools, data, and processes marketing depends on)

Instead of: Sales Rep

Consider: Sales Enablement (you control training, tools, and resources all reps need)

Instead of: Product Manager

Consider: Product Operations (you control roadmap process, metrics, and cross-functional coordination)

**Why this works:** Infrastructure-adjacent roles are OPPs. Everyone depends on you, but few people compete for these roles because they're not flashy.

---

**Strategy 2: Control the Data**

Whoever controls data controls reality (for decision-makers).

**Tactics:**

- Become the person who builds the reports leadership reads
- Own the dashboard that tracks key metrics
- Control the data pipeline
- Be the analyst who interprets results

**Why this works:** Leadership makes decisions based on data. Control the data, you control the narrative.

---

**Strategy 3: Own the Coordination**

In cross-functional projects, everyone is busy. No one wants to coordinate. You do.

**Tactics:**

- Volunteer to run cross-functional projects
- Be the person who schedules, tracks, and synthesizes
- Become the connector between disconnected teams

**Why this works:** You become the hub. Information flows through you. You see everything. You're necessary for coordination.

---

**Strategy 4: Become the Expert on a Critical System**

Pick a system everyone depends on but few people understand.

**Tactics:**

- Master the CRM
- Own the project management tool
- Become the Salesforce admin
- Control the knowledge base

**Why this works:** Technical expertise creates dependency. People need you to make things work.

---

**Strategy 5: Get on Approval Committees**

**Tactics:**

- Join the hiring committee
- Get on the budget approval committee
- Sit on the promotion review board
- Be part of the architecture review

**Why this works:** You have structural veto power. Nothing moves without you.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è THE ETHICS OF OPP CONTROL

**Controlling an OPP gives you power. How you use it determines whether you're valued or resented.**

**Bad OPP Controller:**
- Bottlenecks unnecessarily
- Hoards information
- Creates dependency for ego
- Blocks to feel powerful

**Result:** Removed as soon as possible. People route around you.

**Good OPP Controller:**
- Accelerates important work
- Shares information strategically
- Makes the system work better
- Uses power to serve organizational goals

**Result:** Protected and valued. People defend your position because you make their lives easier.

**Key principle: Control the passage point to serve the system, not just yourself. This makes you essential and respected.**

## üåç REAL-WORLD APPLICATION

### In Your Career

**Standard Approach:**
You compete for manager/director roles based on visibility and performance. You're one of many qualified candidates.

**OPP Approach:**
You position yourself as the person who controls critical data, coordinates key cross-functional projects, or manages essential infrastructure. You become structurally difficult to replace. Promotion becomes inevitable because removing you breaks the system.

---

### In Organizations

**Standard Approach:**
You build authority through formal hierarchy. You give orders. You rely on position power.

**OPP Approach:**
You control passage points. You don't need formal authority because people need you to get things done. You have influence without a fancy title.

---

### In Entrepreneurship

**Standard Approach:**
You try to be great at everything.

**OPP Approach:**
You identify what your customers absolutely need (the obligatory passage point in their workflow) and own that completely. You become essential to their process.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION BLUEPRINT

### Step 1: Complete the 30-Day Power Circuit Audit

**Map information, decisions, resources, and technical dependencies in your org.**

Identify the top 10 OPPs.

---

### Step 2: Assess Your Current Position

**Are you currently at an OPP?**

**Test:**
- If you left tomorrow, would something break?
- Do people need to go through you for anything critical?
- Do you control access, information, resources, approvals, or systems?

**If no, you're peripheral. Time to reposition.**

---

### Step 3: Identify Your Target OPP

**Based on your audit, what's the most accessible OPP for you?**

**Criteria:**
- Currently uncontrolled or weakly controlled
- Critical to the org
- Aligned with your skills
- Not heavily competed for

**Pick one. This is your target.**

---

### Step 4: Position Yourself

**Create a plan to control that OPP within 3-6 months:**

**If it's a system:** Become the expert. Offer to maintain/improve it.

**If it's data:** Build the reports. Own the analysis.

**If it's coordination:** Volunteer to run the cross-functional project.

**If it's approval:** Get yourself on the committee.

**Execute the plan.**

---

### Step 5: Prove Value, Then Consolidate

**Once you're at the OPP:**

**Prove value:** Make things work better. Accelerate important work.

**Consolidate:** Document your role. Train others (but not fully). Make yourself essential but not a single point of failure.

**Expand:** Once you control one OPP, identify the next.

---

### Step 6: Build a Network of OPP Controllers

**Identify other OPP controllers in your org.**

Build relationships with them. You control one passage point. They control others. Alliance = massive structural power.

**Together, you control the infrastructure. That's untouchable.**

---

## üéØ KEYS TO POWER

1. **Obligatory Passage Points are choke points where resources, information, or decisions must flow through.** Control an OPP, control power.

2. **OPPs are structural, not relational.** The power comes from the position in the system, not from personal charisma or relationships.

3. **Six types of OPPs: Access, Information, Resources, Approval, Technical, Coordination.** Identify which exist in your org.

4. **Most people compete for visible positions. Smart people position themselves at invisible but essential OPPs.**

5. **Infrastructure-adjacent roles are undervalued OPPs.** Operations, enablement, coordination‚Äîthese control the systems everyone depends on.

6. **Control data = control reality for decision-makers.** Own the reports, own the narrative.

7. **Use OPP power to serve the system, not just yourself.** Be the person who accelerates work, and you become irreplaceable and valued.
