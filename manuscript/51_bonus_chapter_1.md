## üìç AVATAR STATE CHECK-IN

**BEFORE THIS CHAPTER:**
You think power is simple: whoever has the authority wins. You see the boss giving orders, the CEO making decisions, the manager approving budgets‚Äîand you think that's where power lives. You're playing on the surface level, competing for visible positions and formal titles. You're frustrated because you're working hard, producing results, but people with less skill are getting ahead. You don't understand the invisible game being played around you. You're focused on what you can see while the real power players are operating on levels you don't even know exist.

**AFTER THIS CHAPTER:**
You'll understand Stewart Clegg's three circuits of power‚Äîthe framework that reveals how power actually flows in organizations. You'll see that most people are stuck competing in Circuit 1 (daily battles) while the real players control Circuit 2 (the rules) and Circuit 3 (the infrastructure). You'll learn to operate on all three levels simultaneously, giving you a strategic advantage that makes you nearly untouchable. You'll stop fighting for scraps on the surface and start positioning yourself where real power compounds.

## üíé VALUE STATEMENT

This framework is advanced game theory for organizations. When you understand the three circuits, you stop being a pawn and start being a player. You'll see opportunities others miss, avoid traps others fall into, and accumulate power faster than people who only play the visible game. The ROI is leverage‚Äîyou'll achieve more with less effort by operating on the right levels.

## üß∂ OPENING STORY: The Three Players

Same company. Three people. Three completely different power strategies. Alex works seventy-hour weeks, delivers exceptional results, fights every battle, wins most of them through sheer competence and effort. Exhausted. Gets promoted slowly. Respected for work ethic, but constantly fighting for every inch. Maya works forty-five-hour weeks, produces good results but not exceptional ones. But Maya rewrote the performance review criteria to emphasize skills she has. She sits on the committee that decides promotion standards. She doesn't fight battles‚Äîshe changes the rules so the battles favor her. Gets promoted faster than Alex despite producing less.

Jordan works forty-hour weeks with decent results. But Jordan controls the project management software everyone uses. Jordan decides what metrics are tracked, what data leadership sees, how workflows are structured. Jordan doesn't fight battles or change rules‚ÄîJordan controls the infrastructure that determines what battles are even possible. Gets promoted fastest because leadership can't function without the systems Jordan controls. **Three circuits. Three levels of power. Only one playing the full game.**

## üí° CORE LESSON: THE THREE CIRCUITS EXPLAINED

Stewart Clegg, one of the most brutal organizational theorists, identified something most people never see: **power operates on three distinct levels simultaneously.** Most people only see Circuit 1. Smart people learn Circuit 2. Apex players master all three.

Circuit 1 is episodic power‚Äîthe daily battles. This is the most visible level of power. Person A tells Person B to do something. Person B either complies or resists. You see this everywhere: boss delegates task to employee, manager approves or denies a request, leader makes a decision, person persuades another person. **This is what most people think power is.** Circuit 1 is immediate and visible, relationship-based (who has authority over whom), zero-sum (if I win, you lose), exhausting (every win requires effort), and fragile (changes with relationships and positions). Your manager assigns you a project. You negotiate a deadline extension. You convince a colleague to support your idea. You delegate work to a junior employee. These are all Circuit 1 interactions.

The Circuit 1 trap catches most people for their entire careers. They compete for positions, authority, approval. They win individual battles through competence, charisma, or effort. **Problem: Circuit 1 power is temporary and exhausting.** You have to keep fighting. Every decision is a battle. Every win requires energy. The moment you lose your position or relationship, your power evaporates. **Circuit 1 players work the hardest and gain the least leverage.**

Circuit 2 is dispositional power‚Äîthe rules of the game. This is the level where structures, rules, norms, and procedures determine what kinds of power moves are possible. Circuit 2 doesn't fight battles‚Äîit determines what battles can be fought and how they can be won. **This level is less visible than Circuit 1.** It shapes what's "normal," "acceptable," "possible." It creates recurring advantage because the rules keep favoring you. It's more efficient: set the rules once, benefit repeatedly. It's institutional, embedded in systems and norms.

Circuit 2 manifests in performance review criteria‚Äîwhat gets rewarded? Promotion standards‚Äîwhat qualifies someone? Decision-making processes‚Äîwho has to approve what? Organizational structure‚Äîwho reports to whom? Budget allocation rules‚Äîwho controls resources? **Circuit 2 players don't compete in the game‚Äîthey shape the game to favor their strengths.** Real-world example: you're not the best coder on the team. But you get yourself on the committee that defines "senior engineer" criteria. You emphasize communication and mentorship (your strengths) and de-emphasize raw technical skill (your weakness). **Result: the rules now favor you.** You get promoted without being the best coder because you changed what "best" means. **Circuit 2 players work smarter, not harder.**

Circuit 3 is facilitative power‚Äîthe infrastructure. This is the deepest level. The technology, systems, platforms, and infrastructure that make certain actions possible or impossible. Circuit 3 doesn't set the rules‚Äîit determines what can exist. **This is the invisible layer most people never even think about.** Circuit 3 is nearly invisible to most people, determines what's technically possible, creates structural dependency (people need the infrastructure), is extremely powerful (infrastructure shapes everything above it), and is the hardest to build but most durable.

Examples of Circuit 3 include the software platform everyone uses (controls data, workflow, visibility), the communication tools (controls information flow), the financial systems (controls who can spend what), the knowledge base (controls what information exists and who can access it), and the physical infrastructure (office layout, security systems). **Circuit 3 players control the infrastructure. Whoever controls the infrastructure controls the game at a fundamental level.**

Real-world example: you're the IT person who implemented the company's project management system. You didn't write the rules, but you control what data is tracked, what reports leadership sees, who has access to what information, and what workflows are possible. **Result: leadership makes decisions based on the infrastructure you control. You shape reality by controlling what's visible and possible.** Circuit 3 players don't fight‚Äîthey define what fighting looks like.

The circuits are nested. Each level shapes the one above it. Circuit 3 (infrastructure) shapes what's possible. Circuit 2 (rules) shapes what's acceptable. Circuit 1 (daily battles) determines who wins individual interactions. **Example: promotion decision.** Circuit 1 visible level has Alex and Maya both wanting the promotion. They compete. One wins. Circuit 2 rules level shows that Maya influenced the promotion criteria to favor her skills. The game is rigged before it starts. Circuit 3 infrastructure level reveals that Jordan controls the performance tracking system. Jordan determines what metrics exist, what leadership sees. Jordan shapes what's even measurable.

Result: Alex fights hard and might win based on visible performance. Maya fights smart by shaping the rules. Jordan doesn't fight‚ÄîJordan controls what performance means by controlling the infrastructure. **The person operating on the deepest circuit has the most power.**

Why do most people lose? Because they only see Circuit 1. They see authority, battles, negotiations. They try to win through effort, competence, charisma. **Meanwhile, Circuit 2 players are changing the rules to favor themselves, and Circuit 3 players are controlling the infrastructure that determines what's possible.** Circuit 1 players are working seventy-hour weeks fighting battles. Circuit 2 players are working forty-hour weeks winning by changing the rules. Circuit 3 players are working thirty-hour weeks shaping reality itself. **Same company. Completely different games.**

## üåç REAL-WORLD APPLICATION

In your career, playing Circuit 1 only has you working hard, producing results, fighting for recognition. You're exhausted. You get promoted slowly. Adding Circuit 2 has you getting on committees, influencing performance standards, shaping decision-making processes, making the rules favor your strengths. You get promoted faster with less effort. Adding Circuit 3 has you controlling key systems, becoming the person leadership depends on for data, tools, infrastructure. You're irreplaceable. You have leverage without authority.

In organizations, Circuit 1 only has you giving orders, dealing with people who comply or resist, fighting every battle. Adding Circuit 2 has you changing policies, processes, structures, making your preferred outcomes the default. Adding Circuit 3 has you controlling the systems everyone relies on, shaping what's visible, what's measurable, what's possible.

In projects, Circuit 1 only has you persuading people to support your project one meeting at a time. Adding Circuit 2 has you getting your project type prioritized in the official roadmap. Now similar projects get automatic support. Adding Circuit 3 has you building the system that tracks all projects. You determine what metrics matter. Your project type becomes structurally advantaged.

## üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION BLUEPRINT

Map your current circuit position. Ask yourself: where are you playing? Circuit 1 indicators include fighting for every win, having power that depends on relationships, working long hours to stay ahead, and losing power when you lose a position. Circuit 2 indicators include sitting on decision-making committees, influencing policies and standards, shaping what's rewarded, and having recurring advantage from rules you helped set. Circuit 3 indicators include controlling key systems or infrastructure, being depended on for tools or platforms, shaping what data exists and who sees it, and being structurally difficult to replace. **Most people are ninety-five percent Circuit 1, five percent Circuit 2, zero percent Circuit 3.**

Identify Circuit 2 opportunities. Ask: where can you shape the rules? Look for committees you can join, standards you can influence, processes you can redesign, criteria you can help define. **Target: get on at least one Circuit 2 position within three months.**

Build Circuit 3 assets. Ask: what infrastructure can you control? Examples include implementing a new tool or system, becoming the expert on a critical platform, building the knowledge base, controlling a key dataset, owning the reporting dashboard. **Target: control at least one piece of infrastructure within six months.**

Play all three circuits simultaneously. Don't abandon Circuit 1. Master all three. Circuit 1: deliver results, build relationships, win daily battles. Circuit 2: shape rules to favor you. Circuit 3: control infrastructure that others depend on. **This makes you nearly untouchable.**

## üéØ KEYS TO POWER

1. **Most people only see Circuit 1 (daily battles). Apex players master all three circuits.**

2. **Circuit 1 is exhausting.** You fight for every win. Power is temporary and relationship-dependent.

3. **Circuit 2 is efficient.** You change the rules once and benefit repeatedly.

4. **Circuit 3 is dominant.** You control infrastructure, you shape what's possible.

5. **The circuits are nested.** Each level shapes the one above it. Deeper circuits equal more power.

6. **Technical excellence isn't enough.** If you're only good at Circuit 1, you'll be outplayed by people operating on Circuits 2 and 3.

7. **Get on committees (Circuit 2) and control systems (Circuit 3)** to build leverage beyond your formal authority.

## üåâ BRIDGE TO BONUS CHAPTER 2

You now understand the three circuits. You see that power operates on multiple levels, and most people are only playing on one.

But there's a specific concept within this framework that's even more tactical: **Obligatory Passage Points.**

These are the choke points in any system‚Äîthe places where resources, information, or decisions must flow through.

**Control an obligatory passage point, and you control disproportionate power regardless of your formal position.**

Bonus Chapter 2 will show you how to identify these passage points, position yourself near them, and build the kind of structural leverage that makes you irreplaceable.
