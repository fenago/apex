# BONUS CHAPTER 1
## THE THREE CIRCUITS: THE INVISIBLE GAME EVERYONE'S PLAYING
*Understanding Clegg's Framework of Power*

---

## üìç AVATAR STATE CHECK-IN

**BEFORE THIS CHAPTER:**
You think power is simple: whoever has the authority wins. You see the boss giving orders, the CEO making decisions, the manager approving budgets‚Äîand you think that's where power lives. You're playing on the surface level, competing for visible positions and formal titles. You're frustrated because you're working hard, producing results, but people with less skill are getting ahead. You don't understand the invisible game being played around you. You're focused on what you can see while the real power players are operating on levels you don't even know exist.

**AFTER THIS CHAPTER:**
You'll understand Stewart Clegg's three circuits of power‚Äîthe framework that reveals how power actually flows in organizations. You'll see that most people are stuck competing in Circuit 1 (daily battles) while the real players control Circuit 2 (the rules) and Circuit 3 (the infrastructure). You'll learn to operate on all three levels simultaneously, giving you a strategic advantage that makes you nearly untouchable. You'll stop fighting for scraps on the surface and start positioning yourself where real power compounds.

## üíé VALUE STATEMENT

This framework is advanced game theory for organizations. When you understand the three circuits, you stop being a pawn and start being a player. You'll see opportunities others miss, avoid traps others fall into, and accumulate power faster than people who only play the visible game. The ROI is leverage‚Äîyou'll achieve more with less effort by operating on the right levels.

## ‚úíÔ∏è DEEP QUOTE

> "Power is not a thing but a relation." ‚Äî Stewart Clegg

> "The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting." ‚Äî Sun Tzu

> "The fish who keeps on swimming is the one who doesn't see the net." ‚Äî Stewart Clegg

These quotes reveal the truth: real power isn't about force‚Äîit's about controlling the game itself.

## üß∂ OPENING STORY: The Three Players

**Same company. Three people. Three completely different power strategies.**

**Alex (Circuit 1 Player):** Works 70-hour weeks. Delivers exceptional results. Fights every battle. Wins most of them through sheer competence and effort. Exhausted. Gets promoted slowly. Respected for work ethic, but constantly fighting for every inch.

**Maya (Circuit 2 Player):** Works 45-hour weeks. Good results, not exceptional. But Maya rewrote the performance review criteria to emphasize skills she has. She sits on the committee that decides promotion standards. She doesn't fight battles‚Äîshe changes the rules so the battles favor her. Gets promoted faster than Alex despite producing less.

**Jordan (Circuit 3 Player):** Works 40-hour weeks. Decent results. But Jordan controls the project management software everyone uses. Jordan decides what metrics are tracked, what data leadership sees, how workflows are structured. Jordan doesn't fight battles or change rules‚ÄîJordan controls the infrastructure that determines what battles are even possible. Gets promoted fastest because leadership can't function without the systems Jordan controls.

**Three circuits. Three levels of power. Only one playing the full game.**

## üí° CORE LESSON: THE THREE CIRCUITS EXPLAINED

Stewart Clegg, one of the most brutal organizational theorists, identified something most people never see: **power operates on three distinct levels simultaneously.**

Most people only see Circuit 1. Smart people learn Circuit 2. Apex players master all three.

---

### CIRCUIT 1: EPISODIC POWER
*The Daily Battles*

**What it is:**

The most visible level of power. A tells B to do something. B either complies or resists. You see this everywhere:

- Boss delegates task to employee
- Manager approves or denies a request
- Leader makes a decision
- Person A persuades Person B

**This is what most people think power is.**

**Characteristics:**

- Immediate and visible
- Relationship-based (who has authority over whom)
- Zero-sum (if I win, you lose)
- Exhausting (every win requires effort)
- Fragile (changes with relationships and positions)

**Examples:**

- Your manager assigns you a project
- You negotiate a deadline extension
- You convince a colleague to support your idea
- You delegate work to a junior employee

**The Circuit 1 Trap:**

Most people spend their entire careers fighting in Circuit 1. They compete for positions, authority, approval. They win individual battles through competence, charisma, or effort.

**Problem:** Circuit 1 power is temporary and exhausting.

You have to keep fighting. Every decision is a battle. Every win requires energy. The moment you lose your position or relationship, your power evaporates.

**Circuit 1 players work the hardest and gain the least leverage.**

---

### CIRCUIT 2: DISPOSITIONAL POWER
*The Rules of the Game*

**What it is:**

The structures, rules, norms, and procedures that determine what kinds of power moves are possible. This is the level where the game itself is defined.

Circuit 2 doesn't fight battles‚Äîit determines what battles can be fought and how they can be won.

**Characteristics:**

- Less visible than Circuit 1
- Shapes what's "normal," "acceptable," "possible"
- Creates recurring advantage (the rules keep favoring you)
- More efficient (set the rules once, benefit repeatedly)
- Institutional (embedded in systems and norms)

**Examples:**

- Performance review criteria (what gets rewarded?)
- Promotion standards (what qualifies someone?)
- Decision-making processes (who has to approve what?)
- Organizational structure (who reports to whom?)
- Budget allocation rules (who controls resources?)

**The Circuit 2 Advantage:**

Circuit 2 players don't compete in the game‚Äîthey shape the game to favor their strengths.

**Real-world example:**

You're not the best coder on the team. But you get yourself on the committee that defines "senior engineer" criteria. You emphasize communication and mentorship (your strengths) and de-emphasize raw technical skill (your weakness).

**Result:** The rules now favor you. You get promoted without being the best coder because you changed what "best" means.

**Circuit 2 players work smarter, not harder.**

---

### CIRCUIT 3: FACILITATIVE POWER
*The Infrastructure*

**What it is:**

The deepest level. The technology, systems, platforms, and infrastructure that make certain actions possible or impossible. Circuit 3 doesn't set the rules‚Äîit determines what can exist.

**This is the invisible layer most people never even think about.**

**Characteristics:**

- Nearly invisible to most people
- Determines what's technically possible
- Creates structural dependency (people need the infrastructure)
- Extremely powerful (infrastructure shapes everything above it)
- Hardest to build but most durable

**Examples:**

- The software platform everyone uses (controls data, workflow, visibility)
- The communication tools (controls information flow)
- The financial systems (controls who can spend what)
- The knowledge base (controls what information exists and who can access it)
- The physical infrastructure (office layout, security systems, etc.)

**The Circuit 3 Dominance:**

Circuit 3 players control the infrastructure. Whoever controls the infrastructure controls the game at a fundamental level.

**Real-world example:**

You're the IT person who implemented the company's project management system. You didn't write the rules, but you control:
- What data is tracked
- What reports leadership sees
- Who has access to what information
- What workflows are possible

**Result:** Leadership makes decisions based on the infrastructure you control. You shape reality by controlling what's visible and possible.

**Circuit 3 players don't fight‚Äîthey define what fighting looks like.**

---

## üîó HOW THE CIRCUITS INTERACT

**The circuits are nested. Each level shapes the one above it.**

```
Circuit 3 (Infrastructure)
    ‚Üì shapes what's possible
Circuit 2 (Rules)
    ‚Üì shapes what's acceptable
Circuit 1 (Daily Battles)
    ‚Üì who wins individual interactions
```

**Example: Promotion Decision**

**Circuit 1 (Visible):**
Alex and Maya both want the promotion. They compete. One wins.

**Circuit 2 (Rules):**
But Maya influenced the promotion criteria to favor her skills. The game is rigged before it starts.

**Circuit 3 (Infrastructure):**
But Jordan controls the performance tracking system. Jordan determines what metrics exist, what leadership sees. Jordan shapes what's even measurable.

**Result:**

Alex fights hard and might win based on visible performance.

Maya fights smart by shaping the rules.

Jordan doesn't fight‚ÄîJordan controls what performance means by controlling the infrastructure.

**The person operating on the deepest circuit has the most power.**

---

## üéÆ WHY MOST PEOPLE LOSE

**Because they only see Circuit 1.**

They see authority, battles, negotiations. They try to win through effort, competence, charisma.

**Meanwhile:**

- Circuit 2 players are changing the rules to favor themselves
- Circuit 3 players are controlling the infrastructure that determines what's possible

**Circuit 1 players are working 70-hour weeks fighting battles.**

**Circuit 2 players are working 40-hour weeks winning by changing the rules.**

**Circuit 3 players are working 30-hour weeks shaping reality itself.**

**Same company. Completely different games.**

## üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION BLUEPRINT

### Step 1: Map Your Current Circuit Position

**Where are you playing?**

**Circuit 1 Indicators:**
- You fight for every win
- Your power depends on relationships
- You work long hours to stay ahead
- Losing a position means losing power

**Circuit 2 Indicators:**
- You sit on decision-making committees
- You influence policies and standards
- You shape what's rewarded
- You have recurring advantage from rules you helped set

**Circuit 3 Indicators:**
- You control key systems or infrastructure
- People depend on your tools/platforms
- You shape what data exists and who sees it
- You're structurally difficult to replace

**Most people are 95% Circuit 1, 5% Circuit 2, 0% Circuit 3.**

### Step 2: Identify Circuit 2 Opportunities

**Where can you shape the rules?**

**Look for:**
- Committees you can join
- Standards you can influence
- Processes you can redesign
- Criteria you can help define

**Target:** Get on at least one Circuit 2 position within 3 months.

### Step 3: Build Circuit 3 Assets

**What infrastructure can you control?**

**Examples:**
- Implement a new tool/system
- Become the expert on a critical platform
- Build the knowledge base
- Control a key dataset
- Own the reporting dashboard

**Target:** Control at least one piece of infrastructure within 6 months.

### Step 4: Play All Three Circuits Simultaneously

**Don't abandon Circuit 1. Master all three.**

**Circuit 1:** Deliver results, build relationships, win daily battles

**Circuit 2:** Shape rules to favor you

**Circuit 3:** Control infrastructure that others depend on

**This makes you nearly untouchable.**

## üéØ KEYS TO POWER

1. **Most people only see Circuit 1 (daily battles). Apex players master all three circuits.**

2. **Circuit 1 is exhausting. You fight for every win. Power is temporary and relationship-dependent.**

3. **Circuit 2 is efficient. You change the rules once and benefit repeatedly.**

4. **Circuit 3 is dominant. You control infrastructure, you shape what's possible.**

5. **The circuits are nested. Each level shapes the one above it. Deeper circuits = more power.**

6. **Technical excellence isn't enough. If you're only good at Circuit 1, you'll be outplayed by people operating on Circuits 2 and 3.**

7. **Get on committees (Circuit 2) and control systems (Circuit 3) to build leverage beyond your formal authority.**

## üåâ BRIDGE TO BONUS CHAPTER 2

You now understand the three circuits. You see that power operates on multiple levels, and most people are only playing on one.

But there's a specific concept within this framework that's even more tactical:

**Obligatory Passage Points.**

These are the choke points in any system‚Äîthe places where resources, information, or decisions must flow through.

**Control an obligatory passage point, and you control disproportionate power regardless of your formal position.**

Bonus Chapter 2 will show you how to identify these passage points, position yourself near them, and build the kind of structural leverage that makes you irreplaceable.
