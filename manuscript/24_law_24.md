# CHAPTER 24
## LAW 24: MOST SUPPORT IS PERFORMATIVE
*They Cheer You On Until You Surpass Them*

## üìç AVATAR STATE CHECK-IN

**BEFORE THIS CHAPTER:**
You believe the people who say "I support you." You take encouragement at face value. You share your goals and wins with people who smile and nod. But when you actually start succeeding, you notice the shift. The enthusiasm cools. The questions get sharper, tinged with skepticism. The "support" that felt genuine when you were struggling evaporates when you start winning. You're confused and hurt because you thought they wanted this for you. You didn't realize that most people only support you when your success doesn't threaten their self-image.

**AFTER THIS CHAPTER:**
You'll understand that performative support is cheap and abundant. You'll learn to distinguish between genuine allies and people who only cheer when you're beneath them. You'll master the skill of selective sharing‚Äîreserving your wins for those who can genuinely celebrate them. You'll discover that real support is measured not by who cheers you on, but by who stays when you start winning.

---

## üíé VALUE STATEMENT

This law protects your energy and relationships. When you understand that most support is performative, you stop seeking validation from people who are secretly rooting for you to stay small. You build a tighter circle of real allies and stop wasting emotional energy on fake cheerleaders. The ROI is clarity‚Äîyou'll know who's actually in your corner.

## üß∂ OPENING STORY: The Friend Who Disappeared

Jenna and Rachel had been best friends since college. When Jenna started her business, Rachel was her biggest cheerleader‚Äî"You've got this! I'm so proud of you! Let me know how I can help!" Year one: business struggled, Jenna was stressed and barely breaking even while Rachel was there listening to vent sessions, offering encouragement, being supportive. Year two: business took off, Jenna hit six figures in revenue, hired her first employees, got featured in a local business magazine. Jenna excitedly shared the news with Rachel. Rachel's response: "That's... great. Must be nice." The tone was off‚Äîcold, not congratulatory, resentful.

Over the next months Rachel stopped asking about the business, when Jenna shared wins Rachel changed the subject, Rachel made passive-aggressive comments like "Must be easy when you get lucky," and eventually Rachel just ghosted. Jenna was devastated: "I thought she wanted this for me. What changed?" **What changed: Jenna's success made Rachel feel inadequate.** When Jenna was struggling, Rachel felt useful and superior. When Jenna succeeded, Rachel felt left behind. **The support was never about Jenna. It was about Rachel's ego.**

## üí° CORE LESSON: THE PERFORMATIVE SUPPORT PARADOX

Here's the brutal truth: **most people support you conditionally‚Äîas long as you don't surpass them.** The pattern unfolds in three phases. **Phase One is You're Struggling:** they're supportive, encouraging, helpful because your failure validates their own stagnation and they feel safe and superior. **Phase Two is You're Succeeding:** support cools, comments turn skeptical or passive-aggressive, and they distance themselves. **Phase Three is You're Thriving:** they're gone or actively undermining because your success is a mirror they can't face.

Why performative support happens comes down to three reasons. First, **your success highlights their stagnation.** When you rise, it forces them to confront their own lack of progress. Instead of being inspired, they feel judged. Second, **they were supporting their self-image, not you.** Being your cheerleader made them feel generous and important. Your actual success removes their role‚Äîthey're no longer needed. Third, **envy masquerading as support:** consciously or not, they wanted you to stay where you were‚Äîrelatable, accessible, non-threatening. Success breaks that dynamic.

The Support Spectrum separates performative from real support. **Performative Support (Fake)** has these characteristics: enthusiastic when you're starting or struggling, cool or distant when you succeed, never actually helps beyond words, seeks credit for "believing in you," and disappears when you don't need them anymore. **Real Support (Rare)** has these characteristics: consistent regardless of your status, genuinely celebrates your wins, shows up with action not just words, no jealousy or resentment, and stays when you're succeeding. **The test: real support survives your success. Performative support doesn't.**

The Crab Bucket Effect explains most social groups. You've seen this: put crabs in a bucket and one tries to climb out while the others pull it back down. This is most social groups. When someone tries to rise above the collective level, the group pulls them back‚Äîconsciously or unconsciously. Why? **Your ascent threatens the group's equilibrium.** If you can succeed, it means they could too‚Äîand they're not. Your success is a referendum on their choices. **So they pull you down** to preserve the group's comfortable mediocrity.

The Selective Sharing Framework recognizes that **not everyone deserves to know your wins.** Before sharing an achievement, ask three questions. First: **"Will this person genuinely celebrate this, or will they feel threatened?"** If threatened, don't share‚Äîprotect your energy. Second: **"Does this person have skin in the game with my success?"** Real supporters benefit when you win like mentors, partners, and true friends. Performative supporters benefit when you struggle because it makes them feel useful. Third: **"Have they proven they can handle my growth?"** Track record matters‚Äîhave they celebrated past wins, or has there been subtle resentment? **The rule: share wins only with people who've proven they can celebrate them.** Everyone else gets the highlight reel version‚Äîpolite, minimal, non-specific.

## üåç REAL-WORLD APPLICATION

In friendships, the naive approach has you sharing every win with your friend group. You notice some pull away when you succeed. You're confused and hurt. You try to downplay your success to keep the friendship. Result: you shrink yourself to make others comfortable. The apex approach has you observing who genuinely celebrates versus who gets weird when you win. You share selectively. You let toxic friendships fade. Result: tighter circle of real supporters.

In family, the naive approach has you assuming family will always support you. You're shocked when they undermine your success or make passive-aggressive comments. Result: you're drained by people who should be in your corner. The apex approach has you recognizing that family can be performative too. You love them but guard your wins. You don't need their validation. Result: you maintain the relationship without emotional dependency.

In professional networks, the naive approach has you broadcasting every achievement. Some colleagues get resentful. Office politics turn against you. Result: your openness backfires. The apex approach has you being strategic about what you share and with whom. You celebrate publicly when appropriate, privately otherwise. Result: you advance without creating unnecessary enemies.

## üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION BLUEPRINT

Run the support audit by listing the people who "support" you. For each, ask: **"When I shared a recent win, how did they respond?"** Genuine celebration means real supporter. Lukewarm or changed subject means performative. Passive-aggressive or resentful means toxic. **Be honest. The data is there.**

Follow the selective sharing rule for the next three months: **only share wins with people who've proven they can celebrate them.** Everyone else gets "Things are going well," "Making progress," or generic updates. **Protect your wins from people who can't handle them.**

Execute the celebration test where next time you have a win, you share it with three to five people. **Observe their reactions carefully:** who asked follow-up questions, who genuinely celebrated, who changed the subject or made it about themselves. **This tells you who's real.**

Apply the distance protocol when someone consistently responds to your success with resentment. Option one: reduce how much you share with them. Option two: let the relationship fade naturally. Option three: have a direct conversation (rarely works, but worth trying if you value them). **You don't owe anyone access to your wins.**

Build the gratitude circle by identifying three to five people who've consistently supported you through struggle and success. **Express gratitude:** "I want you to know: your support has meant a lot. You've been there through the hard parts and celebrated the wins. That's rare. Thank you." **Real supporters deserve acknowledgment.**

Use the energy protection practice by stopping your search for validation from performative supporters. **When they offer empty encouragement, accept politely but internally detach.** "Thanks, I appreciate that." **Then move on. Don't feed the dynamic.**

## üéØ KEYS TO POWER

1. **Most support is performative.** People cheer when you're beneath them. They cool when you surpass them.

2. **Your success threatens their self-image.** When you rise, it forces them to confront their stagnation. They'd rather pull you down than face themselves.

3. **Real support survives your success.** Fake support evaporates when you no longer need it or when you outgrow the person.

4. **The crab bucket is real.** Groups unconsciously pull down anyone trying to rise above the collective level.

5. **Share selectively.** Not everyone deserves to know your wins. Protect your energy from people who can't celebrate you.

6. **Track record > Words.** Anyone can say "I support you." Watch what they do when you actually succeed.

7. **You don't need everyone's approval.** A small circle of real supporters beats a large network of performative cheerleaders.

## üåâ BRIDGE TO LAW 25

You've learned that effort means nothing without results (Law 21), that rejection is a filter (Law 22), that humble people know they're beasts (Law 23), and that most support is performative (Law 24).

You're producing results. You're persisting through rejection. You're owning your competence. You're filtering fake supporters.

But there's one more truth about success that most people aren't ready to hear:

**Success exposes fake friends faster than failure ever could.**

Failure is easy‚Äîeveryone can relate to it, support you through it, bond over it.

**Success is the litmus test.**

**Law 25 will show you why your rising will reveal who's real and who was just waiting for you to fail.**

Because when you win, the masks come off.

Turn the page.
